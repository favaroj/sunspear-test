                                <p>Five years ago, several members of the RTS modding community met to discuss the future of esports. Their passion for a better competitive experience turned to a clear vision: an RTS that anyone could play or watch, with worlds and characters anyone could fall in love with. Five years ago, we started a journey that has bridged the gap between genres, challenged notions of what is possible in RTS, and reimagined what competitive games can do for the world. The way has been long and challenging, hundreds of builds and ideas have been discarded to make way for a truly better game experience. Our long days and longer nights have brought us here and we are excited to share that road you.</p>
